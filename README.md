# WeMail

## Description:
This is an amazing **Email** application that I have build. It uses an **API** for fetching emails, **react-router** to navigate and **filters** to categorise .

### Technologies Used:
1) JavaScript (React JS).
2) Material UI
3) Node Js
4) React-Router

#### What Next?
Add Firebase so that we can create emails as well

#### How to contribute?

_I love building things, it does not matter whether the application is small or huge. So if you are new to this technology and eager to learn, we can go ahead and develop more features in the application._
